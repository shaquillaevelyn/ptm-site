    'text':  'Joining Toastmasters 2 years ago has had such a postive effect on me. I am a far more eloquent, competent and creative speaker; and during the Covid-19 pandemic andhaving all communications move to video calls, I have become more flexible and versatile in my style. These skills I know will be 100% applicable in our new normal! Toastmasters has also allowed me to build in my leadership potential. There is ample opprtuntiy to develop yourself, develop others through mentorship and develop your club to be the best that it could possibly be, through being a part of the club committee. Patiently, I wait for the pandemic to come to an end so we can go back to in person meetings where I can see all the smiling faces of my fellow members.'

    'text':  'I am what you might call a “legacy” in that my mum was a Toastmaster for many years. I am following in her footsteps as well as forging my own path. For me, TMI has allowed me to practice speaking in a safe environment and try out techniques that I might not have had the  supportive and encouraging that you feel free to try things out and give it a go. I have learned that my nerves before a speech can be harnessed as energy rather than a roadblock, and I have learned that nervousness just means I care and want to do my best. I still get nervous but that’s perfectly normal– it’s how you respond to it that matters. Even after many years of being at Paddington TM, I am still learning new skills and really enjoy the relaxed and fun spirit of our club'

One thing I love about PTM is the friendly and encouraging vibe - there are so many amazing people to listen and learn from! '
