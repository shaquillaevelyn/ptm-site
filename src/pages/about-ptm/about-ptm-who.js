                Established in 2017 , Paddinton Toastmasters has always been a
                home for public speaking excellence, personal development and
                loads of fun. Based on the ground floor of the Westbourne Park
                Baptist Church, we transform what is usually a quiet space, into
                a homely yet energetic space to hold out meetings. Since the
                easing of lockdown, we have successfully been able to manage and
                run hybrid meetings to cater to the various needs of our guests
                in person and online.

                <p>
                    Our members come from a number of walks of life, from small
                    business owners, to software developers, to consultants to
                    teachers! Our mutual goal to become public speaking masters
                    in our own right is what binds us together as a club.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our meetings comprise of two halves, the first the home of
                    prepared speeches and the second, an opportunity for members
                    and guests to improve thier impromtu speaking ability. As
                    per the Toastmasters way, all speeches are given feedback so
                    our members continually improve. And this is all captured in
                    the Toastmasters Educational program, Pathways that on
                    becoming a member, access is granted.
