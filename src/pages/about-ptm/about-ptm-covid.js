                    When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, our club was able to adapt
                    to the needs to take our meetings online. <br />
                    Since the world opened up, we have successfully integrated
                    both the digital world and the physical world into our
                    meetings. <br />
                    Our hybrid format allows you, our guests and members to take
                    part either digitally or physically.
                </p>
