                When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, our club was able to adapt to
                the needs to take our meetings online. <br />
                Since the world opened up, we have successfully integrated both
                the digital world and the physical world into our meetings. Our
                hybrid format allows you, our guests and members to take part
                either digitally or physically.
                <br />
                We do hope to welcome you to a meeting in the near future and
                show you in person why Paddington Toastmasters really is A Club
                Like No Other!
